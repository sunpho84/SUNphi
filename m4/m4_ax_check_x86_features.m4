# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_X86_FEATURES([ACTION-IF-FOUND],[ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Checks if the host cpu supports various x86 instruction set, the
#   instructions that will get tested are "sse2, sse3, avx, avx2,
#   avx512f". If the instruction set is supported by the host cpu, the
#   C preprocessor macro HAVE_XXX_INSTRUCTIONS is set to 1. For
#   example, the test for "sse4" would export
#   HAVE_SSE4_INSTRUCTIONS=1. If the flag --enable-XXX is selected,
#   the compiler flag "-msse4" would be added to CXXFLAGS variable.
#
#   This macro requires gcc extended builtin function "__builtin_cpu_init"
#   and "__builtin_cpu_supports" to detect the cpu features. It will error
#   out if the compiler doesn't has these builtins.
#
#   See also AX_GCC_X86_CPU_SUPPORTS, which is the actual macro that perform
#   the checks for the instruction sets.
