# SUNphi: SU(N) on Phi architecture

**Note**: internal documentation generated with Doxygen is available
  [here](https://sunpho84.github.io/SUNphi/html/index.html).

A library to simulate *SU(N)* (and similar) theories, with multinode,
multicore, supervectorized architectures in mind, and a narcissistic
name. Hopefully, a modernistic replacement for
[Nissa](https://github.com/sunpho84/nissa) library.
